# Daily Programmer

I wanted to get some experience working with Cython and C. The subreddit /r/dailyprogrammer offered weekly challenges to test skills algorithm optimization and code clarity. I submitted three solutions, which are stored here.

I hadn't quite grasped how malloc and free worked so there are some memory leaks here and there, but it was fun and introduced me to the C language.
